<h1>Recipe flags</h1>

<b>WHAT ARE FLAGS ?</b>
  Flags are the stuff that make a recipe very special! You can add various features to a recipe by using flags.
  For examples see <a href="advanced recipes.html"><b>advanced recipes.html</b></a>.

<b>USING FLAGS</b>
  Flags can be added in 3 'zones':
  - at the beginning of the file - which are copied to all recipes from that file
  - after recipe type (CRAFT, COMBINE, etc) - where they affect that specific recipe, you may even overwrite file flags for that specific recipe!
  - after recipe's individual results - to apply flags for the result items.

<b>ABOUT ARGUMENTS</b>
  Flags have arguments but not always are they all required.
  Arguments enclosed between &lt; and &gt; are required and those enclosed between [ and ] are optional.
  Some arguments may have 'or false', that means you can just type false in there to make it do something special (most likely disable the flag or a feature)

<b>ALIASES</b>
  They're just other names for the flag that you can use, they have no special effect if used, only for your preference.

<a name="shared_flags"></a><hr>  <b>SHARED FLAGS</b>
    Usable on anything - file header, recipe header or result items.
<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="command"></a>


  <b>@command &lt;text or false&gt;</b>

    Executes the command when recipe is successful.
    This flag can be used more than once to add more commands to the list.
    
    Commands are executed server-side, if you add / prefix it will execute the command on the crafter.
    
    You can also use these variables:
      {player}         = crafter's name or '(nobody)' if not available
      {playerdisplay}  = crafter's display name or '(nobody)' if not available
      {result}         = the result item name or '(nothing)' if recipe failed.
      {recipename}     = recipe's custom or autogenerated name or '(unknown)' if not available
      {recipetype}     = recipe type or '(unknown)' if not available
      {inventorytype}  = inventory type or '(unknown)' if not available
      {world}          = world name of event location or '(unknown)' if not available
      {x}              = event location's X coord or '(?)' if not available
      {y}              = event location's Y coord or '(?)' if not available
      {z}              = event location's Z coord or '(?)' if not available

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @command /say I crafted {result}!
      @command kick {player}

    <b>Aliases:</b> @cmd, @commands


<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="keepitem"></a>


  <b>@keepitem &lt;ingredient&gt;</b>
  <b>@keepitem &lt;ingredient&gt; | damage &lt;num&gt;</b>
  <b>@keepitem &lt;ingredient&gt; | replace &lt;item&gt;</b>

    Keeps the specified ingredient material from being used when crafting.
    This flag can be used more than once to specify more ingredients.
    
    The &lt;ingredient&gt; argument can be a material:data combination of the ingredient, data value being optional, just like defining an ingredient.
    
    For the optional 'damage &lt;num&gt;' argument you can specify the amount of damage to add or remove from a damageable item.
    Damaging the item beyond its max durability will break it.
    This argument only works for damageable items and the &lt;num&gt; can be a positive number to damage the item or negative to repair it.
    
    For the optional 'replace &lt;item&gt;' argument you can specify an item that will replace the ingredient.
    The &lt;item&gt; on 'replace' argument can support material:data:amount and enchantments, just like recipe results.
    This argument only works for unstackable ingredients. The item specified as replacement can be stackable.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @keepitem iron_axe  // makes the iron_axe ingredient persistent
      @keepitem potion | replace bottle // using any kind of potion would return an empty bottle
      @keepitem diamond_pickaxe | damage 5  // keeps the diamond pickaxe but damages it by 5 points
      @keepitem shears | damage -99999 // keeps shears and fully repairs it

    <b>Aliases:</b> @returnitem, @replaceitem


<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="ingredientcondition"></a>


  <b>@ingredientcondition &lt;item&gt; | &lt;conditions&gt;</b>

    Adds conditions for individual ingredients like ranged data values, enchantments or using stacks.
    This flag can be called more than once to add more ingredients with conditions.
    
    The &lt;item&gt; argument must be an item that is in the recipe, 'material:data' format.
    If you're planning to add ranged data values the data value must be the wildcard '*' or not set at all in order to work.
    
    For &lt;conditions&gt; argument you must specify at least one condition.
    Conditions must be separated by | and can be specified in any order.
    Condition list:
    
      data &lt;[!][&amp;]num or min-max&gt;, [...]
        Condition for data/damage/durability, as argument you can specify data values separated by , character.
        One number is required, you can add another number separated by - character to make a number range.
        Additionally instead of the number you can specify 'item:data' to use the named data value.
        Prefixing with '&amp;' would make a bitwise operation on the data value.
        Prefixing with '!' would reverse the statement's meaning making it not work with the value specified.
        Optionally you can add more data conditions separated by ',' that the ingredient must match against one to proceed.
    
      enchant &lt;name&gt; [[!]num or min-max], [...]
        Condition for applied enchantments (not stored in books).
        This argument can be used more than once to add more enchantments as conditions.
        The name must be an enchantment name, see 'name index.html' at 'ENCHANTMENTS' section.
        The 2nd argument is the levels, it's optional
        A number can be used as level to set that level as requirement.
        You can also use 'max' to use the max supported level for that enchantment.
        Additionally a second number separated by - can be added to specify a level range, 'max' is also supported in ranged value.
        Prefixing with '!' would ban the level or level range.
    
      amount &lt;num&gt;                     = stack amount, this will also subtract from the ingredient when crafted!
      name &lt;text or regex:pattern&gt;     = check the item name against exact text or if prefixed with 'regex:' it will check for a regex pattern.
      lore &lt;text or regex:pattern&gt;     = checks each lore line for a specific text or if prefixed with 'regex:' it will check for a regex pattern.
      leather &lt;colorname or R,G,B&gt;     = only works for leather armor, checks color, the values can be individual values or ranged separated by - char or you can use a color name constant, see 'name index.html' at 'DYE COLOR'.
      failmsg &lt;text&gt;                   = overwrite message sent to crafter when failing to provide required ingredient.
    
    This flag can be used on recipe results to determine a specific outcome for the recipe depending on the ingredients, however in that case you would need 'failmsg false' along with @displayresult flag too, see 'advanced recipes.html' file for example.
    
    NOTE: if an ingredient exists more than once in the recipe then the conditions will apply to all of them.
    NOTE: this flag can not be used in recipe header, needs to be defined on individual results or recipes.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @ingredientcondition wood | data 3 // pointless use of this flag, just use wood:3 as ingredient.
      @ingredientcondition wood | data 1-3, 39, 100 // this overwrites the data condition to the previous one.
      @ingredientcondition dirt | amount 64 // needs a full stack of dirt to work.
      @ingredientcondition iron_sword | data 0-25 // only accepts iron swords that have 0 to 25 damage.
      @ingredientcondition wool | data !wool:red // no red wool
      @ingredientcondition potion | data &amp;16384, !&amp;64 // checks if potion is splash and NOT extended (see http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_value#Potions)
      @ingredientcondition diamond_helmet | enchant fire_resistance 1-3 | enchant thorns | data 0, 5, 50-100 // makes ingredient require 2 enchantments and some specific data values.

    <b>Aliases:</b> @ingrcondition, @ingrcond, @ifingredient, @ifingr


<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="permission"></a>


  <b>@permission [!]&lt;permission&gt;, [...] | [fail message]</b>

    Makes the recipe or item require the crafter to have a permission.
    Using this flag more than once will add more permissions, the player must have at least one to allow crafting.
    
    The '&lt;permission&gt;' argument must be an permission node, regardless if it exists or not.
    
    Adding ! character as prefix to individual permission nodes will do the opposite check, if crafter has permission it will not craft.
    
    You can also specify more permissions separated by , character.
    
    Optionally you can specify a failure message that will be used on the specific permission(s) defined.
    The messages can have the following variables:
      {permission}  = permission that was not found or was found and it's unallowed.
      {permissions}  = a comma separated list of the allowed or unallowed permission nodes.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @permission ranks.vip
      @permission !jobs.builder | &lt;red&gt;Builders can't use this!
      @permission jobs.famer, jobs.trader | &lt;red&gt;You must be a farmer or trader!
      @permission ! ranks.newbs, ! ranks.newbies | &lt;yellow&gt;Noobs can't use this. // valid with spaces too

    <b>Aliases:</b> @permissions, @perm


<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="forpermission"></a>


  <b>@forpermission &lt;permission node&gt; @&lt;flag declaration&gt;</b>

    Adds other flags with permission requirements.
    You can specify this flag more than once to add more permissions or more flags to a permission.
    
    Basically this is a storage for flags and will only trigger them if the crafter has the required permission.
    This is useful for using different values for flags on the same recipe but for different permissions.
    
    The '&lt;permission node&gt;' argument must be a permission node.
    The '&lt;flag declaration&gt;' must be a flag that will work on the current recipe or result.
    For extra awesomeness you can even add this flag inside itself!
    
    NOTE: This will trigger all flags that player has permission for which means that flag effects will stack up.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @exp -2                      // you can use original flag as is for players that do not have the permission
      @forpermission farmer.newbs @exp 4   // add 4 exp to the original -2 exp so player will have +2 exp
      @forpermission farmer.uber @exp 50   // add 50 exp to the original -2 exp and also add 4 exp if the player has that node too
      @forpermission farmer.uber @level 1  // if has required  give the crafter 1 level

    <b>Aliases:</b> @forperm


<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="forchance"></a>


  <b>@forchance &lt;group&gt; [chance]% [^]@[flag declaration]</b>
  <b>@forchance &lt;chance&gt;% [^]@&lt;flag declaration&gt;</b>

    Triggers other flags or groups of flags by specified chance.
    Using this flag more than once will add more flags.
    
    The 'group' argument defines a group for the flags (not permission related), can be any combination of letters only, no spaces either.
    Grouping flags makes the system pick only one flag from the bunch which means it's also limited to 100% total chance.
    If a group is not defined then the flags will be added to the default group which is a special group that will trigger flags randomly according to their chance, it can trigger all at once or even none at all.
    
    The 'chance' argument suggests a chance value that can be between 0.01 and 100 and the '%' suffix is required.
    The chance argument is only optional if there's a group defined, then the remaining chance will be evenly split between all flags with undefined chance.
    
    The 'flag declaration' is a flag like you'd add a flag to a recipe or result, you can even add this flag into itself to make multi-chance structures.
    The flag declaration argument is only optional if there's a group defined and will act as literally nothing.
    Optionally you can prefix the flag declaration with the '^' character to append the data from the flag to the previous flag of the same type from the same group (no group is still a group, but a special one).
    
    NOTE: If using '^' prefix, always use '^' and '@' together like '^@', no space in between.
    NOTE: In a group there must be at least a chance value or a flag declaration.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      // some simple example
      @forchance 25% @explode // 25% chance to explode
      // appending to flags example
      @forchance 80% @command say high chance message!
      @forchance 50% @command say 50-50 message... // this is a totally new flag, individual from the previous one.
      @forchance    ^@command say extra message! // this command will be appended to the previous command flag.
      @forchance    ^@command say extra-large message!!! // this will also add append to the same previous command flag, now it has 3 commands.
      // all flags in a group must have a total of 100% chance since only one triggers, in this case the chance is calculated and it would be 33.33% for each.
      @forchance mystuff @sound level_up
      @forchance mystuff @sound note_bass
      @forchance mystuff @sound hurt
      // example of empty flag definition as nothing chance
      @forchance dostuff @broadcast yay!
      @forchance dostuff 75% // this sets the 'dostuff' group to do nothing 75% of the time
      // forchanception
      @forchance 50% @forchance 25% @forchance test @broadcast chanception occurred!
      // NOTE all of the examples above can be used in a single recipe if you want, there's no limit to the combinations!

<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="group"></a>


  <b>@group [!]&lt;group&gt;, [...] | [fail message]</b>

    Makes the recipe or item require the crafter to be in a permission group.
    Using this flag more than once will add more groups, the player must be in at least one group.
    
    The '&lt;group&gt;' argument must be a permission group.
    
    Adding ! character as prefix to individual groups will do the opposite check, if crafter is in group it will not craft.
    
    You can also specify more groups separated by , character.
    
    Optionally you can specify a failure message that will be used on the specific group(s) defined.
    The messages can have the following variables:
      {group}   = group that was not found or was found and it's unallowed.
      {groups}  = a comma separated list of the allowed or unallowed groups.
    
    NOTE: Vault with a supported permission plugin is required for this flag to work.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @group ranks.vip
      @group !jobs.builder | &lt;red&gt;Builders can't use this!
      @group jobs.famer, jobs.trader | &lt;red&gt;You must be a farmer or trader!

<hr><a href="#contents" style="font-size:12px;">^ Contents</a><a name="world"></a>


  <b>@world [!]&lt;world&gt;, [...] | [fail message]</b>

    Makes the recipe or item work only in certain worlds.
    Using this flag more than once will add more worlds.
    
    The '&lt;world&gt;' argument can be a world name.
    Adding ! character as prefix to individual worlds will do the opposite check, will not craft in specified world.
    You should require or disallow worlds, using both would be logically pointless.
    
    Optionally you can specify a failure message that will be used on the specific world(s) defined.
    The messages can have the following variables:
      {world}   = current world.
      {worlds}  = a comma separated list of the required or unallowed worlds.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @world world // only allows 'world'
      @world !world_nether // disallows 'world_nether'
      @world world1, world2, world3 | &lt;red&gt;Need to be in world 1, 2 or 3! // requires one of the 3 worlds

  <b>@height &lt;min or min-max&gt; | [fail message]</b>

    Checks if crafter or furnace is at least at 'min' height and optionally at most 'max' height.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous one.
    
    Optionally you can overwrite the fail message or you can use 'false' to hide it.
    In the message the following variables can be used:
      {height}  = height or height range

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @height 200 // must be high in the sky
      @height 0-30 | &lt;red&gt;You need to be deep underground!

  <b>@modexp [modifier]&lt;amount&gt; | [fail message]</b>

    Modifies crafter's experience points.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous one.
    
    The '[modifier]' argument can be nothing at all or you can use + (which is the same as nothing, to add), - (to subtract) or = (to set).
    The '&lt;amount&gt;' argument must be the amount of experience to modify.
    The '[fail message]' argument is optional and can be used to overwrite the default message or you can set it to false to hide it. Message will be printed in chat.
    For the fail message you can use the following arguments:
      {amount}       = amount defined in the flag, never has modifier prefix.
      {modifier}     = the modifier prefix.
      {actualamount} = (only works for - modifier) the actual amount lost.
    
    NOTE: This is for total experience points, for experience levels use @modlevel
    NOTE: This flag does not check if player has enough experience when subtracting! Use in combination with @needexp if you want to check.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>

    Optionally you can define a data value which defines its skin, direction and other stuff, see the 'Minecraft Wiki / Data Values' link from the 'name index.html' file.
    You can also use aliases for materials and data values too.
    
    Additionally you can define a set of arguments separated by | character:
      drop            = breaks the existing block and drops its item.
      noinv [failmsg] = prevent inventory crafting, if this is not set, the flag will set the block at player location too; optionally you can overwrite the failure message for this condition.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    The message can also contain variables:
      {player}         = crafter's name or '(nobody)' if not available
      {playerdisplay}  = crafter's display name or '(nobody)' if not available

    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous message.
    
    Optionally you can set a permission node that will define who sees the message.
    
    Colors are supported (&lt;red&gt;, &amp;5, etc).
    The message can also contain variables:

  <b>@secret [true or false]</b>

    Hides the recipe or result from common info sources.
    Recipes are hidden from commands, books, etc.
    Results are also hidden from commands, books and most importantly from multiresult item display.
    This also means recipes/results won't give out any fail craft reasons!

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @secret

    <b>Aliases:</b> @hide



<a name="recipe_only_flags"></a><hr>  <b>RECIPE ONLY FLAGS</b>
    Usable only on file headers or recipe headers. Can not be used on result items.

  <b>@addtobook &lt;book title&gt; [volume &lt;num&gt;]</b>

    This flag is a shortcut for quickly adding recipe(s) to books.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous one.
    
    The book must exist first, you must create it, see 'recipe books.html' for how to do that.
    
    The '&lt;book title&gt;' argument must be an existing book's name, partial matching can be used.
    Optionally you can specify which volume to add it to, otherwise it will be added in its 'recipes' node and left to be added automatically to the latest volume with free slots.
    
    NOTE: To properly remove recipes from books you must first remove this flag (to avoid re-adding them) then go to the book's YML file and remove them from there as well.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @addtobook testingbook // can match a 'Testing Book' book for example
      @addtobook random stuf volume 3 // can match a 'Random Stuff volume 3' book for example

  <b>@failmessage [message or false]</b>

    Changes the message when recipe fails due to failure chance.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous message.
    
    The message supports colors (&lt;red&gt;, &amp;3, etc).
    
    You can also use the following variables inside the message:
      {failchance}    = recipe's chance of failure as a number.
      {successchance} = recipe's chance of success as a number.
      {resultchance}  = result's chance of success as a number.
    
    The same effect can be achieved by using @message on the fail result item.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @failmessage &lt;red&gt;YOU FAILED, MWaHahahah!

  <b>@displayresult &lt;item or first&gt; | [silentfail]</b>

    Sets the display result of the recipe.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous message.
    
    As 'item' argument you can define an item like in a result, material:data:amount.
    Or you can set the item as 'first' to use the first display result available, very useful for multiple results having @ingredientcondition flag on them.
    
    Optionally, using 'silentfail' argument you can make the recipe print no result if it wouldn't give anything in the case of no results being allowed to craft (by other flags, like @ingredientcondition).
    
    NOTE: If there is no item to be displayed (all are secret or unavailable), using this with 'first' will not do anything.
    NOTE: Can only be used on workbench recipes because it can not have effect on other recipes.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @displayresult first // displays the first available result
      @displayresult diamond_helmet:120 // damaged diamond helmet

  <b>@remove [true or false]</b>

    Removes an existing recipe that was added by vanilla Minecraft or other plugins/mods. 
    The recipe definition must have the exact ingredients of the recipe you want to overwrite.
    
    Results and smelt time will be ignored and you don't have to delete them if you want to keep them for later.
    
    If you don't know the exact ingredients you can use 'rmextract' command to extract all existing recipes in RecipeManager format.
    Value is optional, if value is not specified it will just be enabled.
    
    This can't be used along with @override flag.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

  <b>@restrict [fail message]</b>

    Restricts the recipe to everybody.
    This is the player-friendly version of @remove because crafter gets a message when trying to craft the recipe.
    
    Optionally you can overwrite the default restrict message.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>

    The recipe definition must have the exact ingredients of the recipe you want to overwrite.
    
    You may set whatever result(s) you want and add any other flags, this flag allows RecipeManager to take control over that recipe.
    If you don't know the exact ingredients you can use 'rmextract' command to extract all existing recipes in RecipeManager format.
    
    Value is optional, if value is not specified it will just be enabled.

    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous one.
    
    As '&lt;arguments&gt;' you must define at least one feature to copy from the ingredient to the result.
    Arguments can be one or more of the following, separated by | character:
      data [&lt;mod&gt; &lt;value&gt;]   = copy data value with optional modifier, &lt;mod&gt; can be +,-,/,* or % as math operator and &lt;value&gt; a number.
      amount [&lt;mod&gt; &lt;value&gt;] = copy stack amount with optional modifier, &lt;mod&gt; can be +,-,/,* or % as math operator and &lt;value&gt; a number.

      lore                   = copies the custom item lore/description.
      special                = copies item's special feature like leather armor color, firework effects, book contents, skull owner, etc.
      allmeta                = copies enchants, name, lore and special.
      all                    = copies entire item (data, amount, enchants, name, lore, special)
    
    NOTE: If the result's material is present in the ingredients more than once, when using the recipe it will clone the details of first item in the grid.
    
    To apply conditions for ingredients (ranged data values, specific names, etc) then you can use the @ingredientcondition flag too.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @cloneingredient data // just copy data value
      @cloneingredient data +2 // copy data value and add 2 to it
      @cloneingredient amount * 2 // copy amount and multiply it by 2

  <b>@potionitem &lt;basic effect&gt;</b>
  <b>@potionitem custom &lt;custom effect&gt;</b>

    Builds a potion item, only works with POTION item.
    
    There are 2 types of potions... basic potions which have 1 effect and custom potions which can have multiple effects.
    
    Building a basic potion:
    
    Instead of &lt;basic effect&gt; argument you must enter a series of arguments separated by | character, in any order.
    Arguments for basic effect:
      type &lt;potion type&gt;     = (REQUIRED) Type of potion, read 'name index.html' at 'POTION TYPES' section (not POTION EFFECT TYPE!)
      level &lt;number or max&gt;  = (optional) Potion's level/tier, usually 1(default) or 2, you can enter 'max' to set it at highest supported level
      extended               = (optional) Potion has extended duration
      splash                 = (optional) Throwable/breakable potion instead of drinkable
    
    
    Building a custom potion requires adding individual effects:
    
    A basic potion still affects the custom potion like the following:
    - If no basic potion is defined the bottle will look like 'water bottle' with no effects listed, effects still apply when drank
    - Basic potion's type affects bottle liquid color
    - Basic potion's splash still affects if the bottle is throwable instead of drinkable
    - Basic potion's extended and level do absolutely nothing.
    - The first custom effect added is the potion's name, rest of effects are in description (of course you can use @name to change the item name)
    
    Once you understand that, you may use @potion custom as many times to add as many effects you want.
    
    Similar syntax to basic effect, arguments separated by | character, can be in any order.
    Arguments for custom effect:
      type &lt;effect type&gt;  = (REQUIRED) Type of potion effect, read 'name index.html' at 'POTION EFFECT TYPE' section (not POTION TYPE !)
      duration &lt;float&gt;    = (optional) Duration of the potion effect in seconds, default 1 (does not work on HEAL and HARM)
      amplify &lt;number&gt;    = (optional) Amplify the effects of the potion, default 0 (e.g. 2 = &lt;PotionName&gt; III, numbers after potion's max level will display potion.potency.number instead)
      ambient             = (optional) Adds extra visual particles
