  repair: false              # Weapon/tool repair (these aren't actual recipes)

# As of version v2 the plugin generates books with recipes.
# If you add or remove recipes from a book, all book's copies won't be updated because each book is individual (unlike maps).
# This setting makes whenever a player opens a book (uniquely identified by title+author) it will be updated with the latest recipes.
# 
#   default true
update-books: true


# Enable or disable colored log messages
#   default true
color-console: true


# When Shift+Clicking an item in the inventory while a furnace is opened, where should the item go ?
# Values for this setting:
#   fuel - if item is a fuel, will go in fuel slot, otherwise in the ingredient slot (default, like vanilla MC) NOTE: it can get confusing when creating fuels with items that are also ingredients.
#   click - click type determines where the item should go, Shift+LeftClick to ingredient slot and Shift+RightClick to fuel slot.
furnace-shift-click: fuel


# Ticks that the furnace task runs at, 20 ticks is 1 second. Valid values are between 1 and 20.
# Use 2 or more if you have a very slow server OR a lot of burning furnaces at once cause lag.
#   default: 1
furnace-ticks: 1


# Multithreading allows server to do certain tasks in another thread (background) which would avoid freezing the server if it takes too long.
# This is currently used for loading recipes, however if you encounter any weird problems you can disable this to make it run in the main thread.
# Don't take this as a magic-fix! If you don't understand your problem then post it here: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/recipemanager/create-ticket/
#   default: true
multithreading: true


# Internally results are tagged with a lore line to identify the recipe quickly.
# Certain mods/plugins might craft recipes manually and give you the results with that lore line, the line is invisible but it will prevent items from stacking with similar items.
# This setting monitors items in inventories and removes the plugin's lore line if found, it won't affect any other items.
# Use this only if you have plugins or mods that craft results manually !
#   default: false
fix-mod-results: false


# If you want to remove all existing recipes (except your custom recipes and except special ones configured above) from the server, then set this to true.
# Recipes added by this plugin will not be affected of course.

# Automatic update checker (no auto download)
update-check:
  enabled: true     # Enable/disable update checking. (default: true)
  frequency: 6      # Check for updates each N hours, use 0 to check only at startup. (default: 6)


# Enable or disable metrics system for this specific plugin, it will also not create the PluginMetrics folder if this is disabled, but other plugins can use metrics if they have it implemented.
#   default: true
metrics: true
